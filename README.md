# "htx", a php code generator for reusable components
A quick test project for a cli I'll probably be making in the future to add components to php.

You can take a look on the example folder on how you can use this cli tool.
You can run `node index.js` to convert the `example/app/index.htx` file to `output.php`.
After that you can run `php output.php` to see the rendered result or you can look at the raw php code to see what the program does under the hood
